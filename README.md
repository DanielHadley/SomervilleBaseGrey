SomervilleBaseGrey
==================

A map of Somerville styled in Carto CSS for use in TileMill/MapBox

To use, simply download TileMill and place this repository in the projects folder 
(for Windows users, this is usually found at C:\Users\"yourusername"\Documents\MapBox\project). To create a new map based on the Grey Base, copy and paste this folder, then change the folder name. Finally, open the "project.mnl" file in a text editor and replace all instances of "SomervilleBaseGrey" with the name of your new project. Voila.
